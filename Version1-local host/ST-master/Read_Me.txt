Description: Sentiment Analysis of the tweets

Twitter tweets does not give any sentiment analysis as such and also does not contain any gender related fields.
What we have done in our project is we are determining the gender of the user based on their profile picture and then analysing the sentiment of their tweets.
So in this way we are extracting the sentiment and analysing which sention of the soceity tweets positivley or negatively.
Also we have a feature for giving any specific keyword or hashtag. In this way can show that for a given topic the statistics based on the gender analysis.
Also we are calculating the age group based on the profile pic and we determine in this manner which age group tweets the most for a given topic.
